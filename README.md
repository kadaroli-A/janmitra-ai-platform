## 📖 Overview

**JanMitra AI Platform** is a voice-first AI system designed to help rural and low-literacy citizens access government welfare schemes.

Traditional portals require reading skills, form-filling ability, and digital literacy. JanMitra AI instead enables users to interact through natural voice conversation in their local language. The system gathers user details, retrieves verified scheme rules, performs eligibility reasoning, and provides structured outputs to support application processes.

**Mission:** Move from passive information display to active system navigation.
